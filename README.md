# Used-an-unsupervised-method-to-evaluate-features-extraction-performance-for-three-CNN-architectures

Feature extraction is important in image processing. People use feature extraction for image classification. However, in many cases, the image data do not have labels with them. Manually adding labels to them is too time consuming and error-prone. Instead, using unsupervised learning algorithms(such as clustering) is a way that we can learn and partition unlabeled image data. During this process, extracting desirable features from images is a critical part of clustering. Without accurate features as input, the clustering results are meaningless. Traditional image feature extraction algorithms, such as corner detection and scale-invariant feature transform, require careful design experiments and could be very slow. Due to neural networks’ advanced ability to handle large and complex features, especially the convolutional neural networks (CNN) applications for image data, image data’s feature extraction process is more accurate, efficient, and scalable. In this experiment, we compared the feature extraction perfor- mance of three pre-trained CNN architectures: VGG16, ResNet50, and DenseNet121. By evaluating the clustering results (visualization, purity, silhouette coefficient, confusion matrix, etc.), we want to compare which neural networks perform the best on feature extraction for image data.
